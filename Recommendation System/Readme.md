# Recommender System
A Recommender System refers to a system that is capable of predicting the future preference of a set of items for a user, and recommend the top items.
Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix,
YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.
These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. 
There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. 
Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services.

>* **Collaborative filtering** mimics user-to-user recommendations.Collaborative algorithm uses “User Behaviour” for recommending items. They exploit behaviour of other users and items in terms of transaction history, ratings, selection and purchase information. Other users behaviour and preferences over the items are used to recommend items to the new users.
