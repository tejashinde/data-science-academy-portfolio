# Time Series Analysis

Time series is a sequence of data points recorded in time order, often taken at successive equally paced points in time.
Time series data can be taken yearly, monthly, weekly, hourly or even by the minute.
Time Series Analysis comprised methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics 
and other characteristics of the data. It is different from Time Series forecasting which is the use of a model to predict future 
values based on previously observed values. While time series analysis is mostly statistics, with time series forecasting enters Machine Learning. 
Time series analysis is a preparatory step to time series forecasting.

### Autocorrelation
Informally, autocorrelation is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them.

### Seasonality
Seasonality refers to periodic fluctuations. 

### Stationarity
Stationarity is an important characteristic of time series. A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties
do not change over time. In other words, it has constant mean and variance, and covariance is independent of time.

### Trend
Trend is a general direction in which something is developing or changing. A trend can be upward(uptrend) or downward(downtrend). 
It is not always necessary that the increase or decrease is consistently in the same direction in a given period.

#### Modelling and evaluation Techniques

* Modelling: Naive approach, Moving average, Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA), SARIMAX, etc.
* Evaluation: Mean Square Error(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) etc.
