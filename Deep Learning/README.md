## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks
Learning can be :
> supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, machine vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.
> Deep learning is a particular kind of machine learning that achieves great power and flexibility by learning to represent the world as a nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones.

##### Advantages :

>* Best in-class performance on problems.
>* Reduces need for feature engineering.
>* Eliminates unnecessary costs.
>* Identifies defects easily that are difficult to detect.
##### Disadvantages :

>* Large amount of data required.
>* Computationally expensive to train.
