# OPEN CV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

OpenCV is a Python library which is designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV was originally developed in 1999 by Intel but later it was supported by Willow Garage.

OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages such as C++, Python, Java etc. Support for multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

OpenCV Python is nothing but a wrapper class for the original C++ library to be used with Python. Using this, all of the OpenCV array structures gets 
converted to/from NumPy arrays.


This makes it easier to integrate it with other libraries which use NumPy. For example, libraries such as SciPy and Matplotlib.
