# Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. In reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation. The computer employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem. To get the machine to do what the programmer wants, the artificial intelligence gets either rewards or penalties for the actions it performs. Its goal is to maximize the total reward.

It has following major Components :

* **Agent** : An AI algorithm which learns .
* **Environment** : A task/simulation which needs to be solved by the Agent.
* **Action** : How agent interacts with environment .
* **Reward** :  A reward Rt is a scalar feedback signal that indicates how well the agent is doing at time step t. The agentâ€™s job is to maximize the expected sum of rewards.
